Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems aim to correct grammatical mistakes in the text. Error correction can improve the quality of written text in emails, blog post, and chats.
The GEC task can be thought of as a sequence to sequence task where a Transformer model is trained to take an ungrammatical sentence as input and return a grammatically correct sentence.
